### MVC/MVVM

> "Isolate complexity" - Steve McConnell, *Code Complete*

Here is how this project isolates complexity:
- **Model**: Data, including the means to instantiate from source; in this case it is Firestore NSDictionary.
- **ViewModel**: Data formed for specific view purposes. Only show data from the model that the view actually needs. Combine and massage fields with presentation logic.
- **DocumentStore** (aka repository): Data CRUD (create, read, update, delete). This service is injected into the ViewControllers, sets them as its delegate, and tells them when it has updates with documentsDidUpdate().
- **DetailViewControllers** and **TableViewCells**: A view with injected ViewModel(s).
- **ViewController**: Everything else. Use extensions to separate concerns.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 9
